Ncrit
=====

Ncrit is critical number in e^N theory (the disturbance in linearized bl equations grows e^N times before passing to turbulence).

Common values
-------------

- sailplane 12-14
- motorglider 11-13
- clean wind tunnel 10-12
- average wind tunnel 9
- dirty wind tunnel 4-8

Turbulence level relationship with ncrit
----------------------------------------

Tu = e**(- (ncrit + 8.43) / 2.4) * 100

Water
-----

ncrit = 3 is reasonable for submerged foils
