xfoil
-----

 If you see drag values in the mid lift coefficients that are higher than at the high and low lift ends of the polar,
 x-foil is predicting a detached laminar separation bubble.
 Real world drag in the bubble range will be much higher than predicted in x-foil,
 and there will be a serious discontinuity in the AOA vs Cl curve

 Below 60K x-foil can be way off. If there is laminar separation you will see large differences between tunnel data and x-foil
