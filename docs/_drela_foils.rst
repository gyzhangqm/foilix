Drela HT airfoils (tail airfoils)
=================================

HT05 Max thickness 4.8% at 17.1% chord. Max camber 0% at 63.3% chord [link](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=ht05-il)

HT08 Max thickness 5% at 20.2% chord. Max camber 0% at 0% chord [link](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=ht08-il)

HT12 Max thickness 5% at 18.6% chord. Max camber 0% at 0% chord [link](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=ht12-il)

HT13 6.5% HT13 for heavier 2M and light Open gliders [link](http://www.charlesriverrc.org/articles/drelaairfoils/markdrela_tailairfoils.htm)
  
HT14 7.5% HT14 for large heavy gliders [link](http://www.charlesriverrc.org/articles/drelaairfoils/markdrela_tailairfoils.htm)

Gotcha
------

For some reason, these foils (from UIUC database) are not exactly symmetrical. There is a tiny difference between the max
 on the pressure and on the suction size.

RC yacht application

The desired cl range is 0.2 to 0.4 and the thickness to cord can go down to as little as 6%.
Leeway angles up to 5 degrees.
Since you mention leeway, I assume you mean cl = +/-0.2 to +/-0.4 (i.e. a symmetric section).
What you want is a thin RC glider tail airfoil.
The HT08 or HT12 or HT13 should work well. http://www.charlesriverrc.org/articles/drela-airfoilshop/markdrela-ag-ht-airfoils.htm
These have 100% laminar flow in your cl range, and hence are completely immune to low-Re effects,
since laminar separation resistance is independent of Re.
So if this is for an RC sailboat, they will work OK no matter how low the wind speed.
These show how to hand-sand them accurately in wood, without templates:
